# DataFusion-Project-23-24

These code files is connected to the project described in this article: 

Iurgenson, Nika, et al. "Feasibility study of multisensor systems for the assessment of water pollution index induced by heavy metal contamination." Microchemical Journal 197 (2024): 109762.

In the project, the machine learning tools were utilized to predict Pb, Cd and WPI in samples modelling the composition of natural water. The data fusion levels were employed (low-, mid- and high-level) to test whtether the better prediction can be obtained using not individual analytical device (sesor) but multiple.
